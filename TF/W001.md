### Q: If you could study a subject that you have never had the opportunity to study, what would you choose? Explain your choice, using specific reasons and details.

I would choose to study computers for the following reasons. First, many jobs are computer-based. People who do not understand basic computer knowledge may not be able to do their jobs. And nowadays, technology and computers are very closely linked. If you want to follow the development of state-of-art technology, you'd better to know how to operate computer. Secondly, I have a great interest in computers. When I operate a computer, I have a great sense of accomplishment. Finally, if you have some skills in operating a computer, it will be easy to find a job. Take my brother Bob as an example. He wanted to get a job, but he didn't know anything about computers. So for a whole year, he didn't find a job. Then he went to learn the basic skills of computer. Now he works as a secretary in a big company. He says that computers have helped him a lot in his job search and in his work. So that's why I choose to learn computer.
